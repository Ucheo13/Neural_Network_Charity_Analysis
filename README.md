# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview 

With the knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, weâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results 
The target for this model is the is_successful variable and the features are the other variables other than the ones that are not targets or features. EIN and NAME are two variables that should be removed. 

I selected two hidden layers and two output layers and two activation functions with 43 neurons. 
I could not find the optimal configuration to reach target performance. In attempt to do so I tried to add output layers and hidden layers as well as remove. Increasing  and decreasing epochs.

## Conclusion
Overall the accuacy did not reach its goal and potential. What could be done differently is filtering the data more in order to increase the accuracy of the model
